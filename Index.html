Hey there! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Nik Calia, and I'm a Junior at the University of Georgia.
I'm an Applied Mathematics Major, with an Emphasis in Video Game Development, and a Certificate in Computer Science.
Ever since I was a kid, my biggest dream has been to create the next biggest video game that will be talked about years from now.
Over the years, I’ve played a substantial amount of videogames, all of which have contributed to my vast knowledge of what makes a video game good. 
Several driving factors include art style, music composition, storytelling aspects, mechanics, replayability, and perceived level of difficulty.
A good video game is a game that makes you feel a part of the story, one that captivates you with the music and art style, and is something that even after you’ve beaten it, will want to come back to eagerly.

Video games come in all forms of the good, the bad, and the ugly. 
Therefore, it seems like trying to find those high quality games would be a bit of a chore? 
How do I distinguish the good from the bad, the strong from the weak? 
I will admit that I have bought video games from the sheer emotion of having such a game rather than logically thinking about whether or not I would enjoy the game, which led to heartbreak along with a loss of money. 
In order for me to get a good grasp of how good a game is, I have tools at my disposal that help me along the way. 
Several YouTubers who do game analysis like myself come out with videos explaining what’s good and bad about certain games, to help me ascertain which ones I want to buy myself. 
There are also companies, such as <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/"> GameInformer</a> that write articles, scoring games based on those factors that I talked about earlier that are so important to me in a game.
With a good amount of research, I know I won't ever waste money again on a bad videogame.

So what exactly are my plans for the future?
Well my first priority is graduating from UGA in the next couple years.
After that, I will be on the hunt for a job with a top-of-the-line video game developer; maybe I'll go work for Bethesda Game Studios, Ubisoft, or CD Projekt Red.
I do know that after I've worked for a company for some time, I will want to start a company to produce video games of my own design.
Be on the look out for the next biggest title in video game history, coming soon to a store near you!
